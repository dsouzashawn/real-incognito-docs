1.	Data Collection: Relevant data, which could include customer information, sensor data, or text data, is gathered for training the machine learning model.
2.	Sensitive Information Removal: Non-useful or sensitive information, such as personally identifiable details, is removed from the dataset to safeguard individual privacy.
3.	Clustering/Grouping Based on Similarity: The cleaned data is then organized into clusters or groups based on similarities, aiding in subsequent analysis.
4.	Anonymization with Key Metrics Preservation: The data undergoes anonymization processes to protect privacy while retaining essential metrics. 
5.	Application of Machine Learning Algorithms: Machine learning algorithms are applied to the anonymized data to uncover insights and patterns. 
6.	Actionable Insights Utilization: The insights gained from the analysis are then utilized to enhance the product or service.
